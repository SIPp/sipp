Useful tools aside SIPp
=======================



JEdit
`````

`JEdit <http://www.jedit.org/>`_ is a GNU GPL text editor written in
Java, and available on almost all platforms. It's extremely powerful
and can be used to edit SIPp scenarios with syntax checking if you put
the DTD (`sipp.dtd <https://github.com/SIPp/sipp/raw/master/sipp.dtd>`_) in the same directory as your XML scenario.



Wireshark/tshark
````````````````

`Wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org/>`_ is a GNU GPL protocol
analyzer. It was formerly known as Ethereal. It supports SIP/SDP/RTP.





SIP callflow
````````````

When tracing SIP calls, it is very useful to be able to get a call
flow from an wireshark trace. The "callflow" tool allows you to do
that in a graphical way: `callflow <http://callflow.sourceforge.net/>`_

An equivalent exist if you want to generate HTML only call flows
