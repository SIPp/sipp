# Documentation

See the `docs/` directory. It should also be available in html format at:
https://sipp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Build a local copy using: ``sphinx-build docs _build``

# Building

This is the SIPp package. Please refer to the
[webpage](http://sipp.sourceforge.net/) for details and documentation.

Normally, you should be able to build SIPp by using CMake:

```
cmake .
make
```

_The SIPp master branch (3.7.x) requires a modern C++11 compiler._

There are several optional flags to enable features (SIP-over-TLS,
SIP-over-SCTP, media playback from PCAP files and the GNU Scientific
Libraries for random distributions):

```
cmake . -DUSE_SSL=1 -DUSE_SCTP=1 -DUSE_PCAP=1 -DUSE_GSL=1
```

## Static builds

SIPp can be built into a single static binary, removing the need for
libraries to exist on the target system and maximising portability.

This is a [fairly complicated
process](https://medium.com/@neunhoef/static-binaries-for-a-c-application-f7c76f8041cf),
and for now, it only works on Alpine Linux.

To build a static binary, pass `-DBUILD_STATIC=1` to cmake.

An Alpine-based `Dockerfile` is provided, which can be used as a
build-environment.  Build with the following commands:

```
git submodule update --init
docker build -t sipp -f docker/Dockerfile --output=. --target=bin .
```

Special arguments can be passed with `--build-arg`:
* `FULL=1` - build all optional components.
* `DEBUG=1` - build with debug symbols.

## Debian-based docker build

SIPp can be built in a Debian-based docker container. Unlike the Alpine
build, this build is not static, and it supports wolfSSL.

To build a Debian-based docker container, run:
```
git submodule update --init
docker build -t sipp -f docker/Dockerfile.debian .
```

Special arguments can be passed with `--build-arg`:
* `FULL=1` - build all optional components, including OpenSSL.
* `WOLFSSL=1` - build with wolfSSL (only works without FULL).
* `DEBUG=1` - build with debug symbols.

# Support

I try and be responsive to issues raised on Github, and there's [a
reasonably active mailing
list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sipp-users).

# Making a release

* Update CHANGES.md. Tag release. Do a build.
* Make `sipp.1` by calling:
    ```
    help2man --output=sipp.1 -v -v --no-info \
      --name='SIP testing tool and traffic generator' ./sipp
    ```
* Then:
    ```
    mkdir sipp-$VERSION
    git ls-files -z | tar -c --null \
       --exclude=gmock --exclude=gtest --files-from=- | tar -xC sipp-$VERSION
    cp sipp.1 sipp-$VERSION/
    # check version, and do
    cp ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR:-.}/version.h sipp-$VERSION/include/
    tar --sort=name --mtime="@$(git log -1 --format=%ct)" \
          --owner=0 --group=0 --numeric-owner \
          -czf sipp-$VERSION.tar.gz sipp-$VERSION
    ```
* Upload to github as "binary". Note that github replaces tilde sign
  (for ~rcX) with a period.
* Create a static binary and upload this to github as well:
    ```
    docker build -t sipp -f docker/Dockerfile --output=. --target=bin .
    ```

# Contributing

SIPp is free software, under the terms of the GPL licence (see the
LICENCE.txt file for details). You can contribute to the development of
SIPp and use the standard Github fork/pull request method to integrate
your changes integrate your changes. If you make changes in SIPp,
*PLEASE* follow a few coding rules:

  - Please stay conformant with the current indentation style (4 spaces
    indent, standard Emacs-like indentation). Examples:

    ```
    if (condition) {        /* "{" even if only one instruction */
        f();                /* 4 space indents */
    } else {
        char* p = ptr;      /* C++-style pointer declaration placement */
        g(p);
    }
    ```

  - If possible, check that your changes can be compiled on:
      - Linux,
      - Cygwin,
      - Mac OS X,
      - FreeBSD.

Thanks,
